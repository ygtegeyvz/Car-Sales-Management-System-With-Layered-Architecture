== Layered Architecture
N-tier architecture is also called multi-tier architecture because the software is engineered to have the processing, data management, and presentation functions physically and logically separated. 

1.Entities (for data tables)

2.Data Access (All operations related to the database)

3.The data tier.(The layer where all work is done)

4.Interface

== Ninject

Ninject is dependency injector for .NET, practical realisation of pattern Dependency Injection (form of Inversion of Control pattern).

== Entity Framework

Entity Framework is an open-source ORM framework for .NET applications supported by Microsoft. It enables developers to work with data using objects of domain specific classes without focusing on the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored. With the Entity Framework, developers can work at a higher level of abstraction when they deal with data, and can create and maintain data-oriented applications with less code compared with traditional applications.

== Fluent Validation

Fluent validation is one way of setting up dedicated validator objects, which you would use when you want to treat validation logic as separate from business logic.
